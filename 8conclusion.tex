\subsection{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item order is based for a large part on data values. Is the dependence of the order on the data confuscated enough to make the exogeneity assumption valid?
    \item filter on intervention table, these genes were selected as knock-out for a reason, maybe its an easier task? It is definitely a different task.

\end{itemize}
