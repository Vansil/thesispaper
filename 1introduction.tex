\citet{versteeg2019boosting} show LCD as a fast causal inference method on \citet{kemmeren2014large}, with L2-boosting as a necessary preselection to approximate the performance of ICP. It improves the non-causal baseline of pure preselection in the strongest 70 predictions. 

LCD uses an exogenous context variable to infer ancestral relations. \citet{versteeg2019boosting} construct this in the most straightforward way. We try to make it more specific by informing it of the estimated order of variables. 

Contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Metric for ordering, comparison of order methods on Kemmeren
    \item Predictions on the intervention table may be a different task with different properties of the variables
\end{itemize}
