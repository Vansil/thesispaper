\subsection*{Topological Ordering}
The genes in the dataset can be ordered according to their position in the ancestral hierarchy. This order is clearly defined when there are no cycles in the underlying graph. When cycles do exist, we can only infer some order that satisfies many ancestral relations. We hypothesize that an approximation to this underlying topological order can be leveraged to improve causal discovery.

We could assume that the expression values in the intervention data reflect the importance of ancestral relations. We restrict ourselves to relations between genes that are the knock-out gene in some experiment, because we have less information about purely observed genes.
